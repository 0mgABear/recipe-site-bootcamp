    <p class="instructions">Preparation Instructions</p>
    <ul class="prep-instructions">
      1. Boil a large pot of water. In the meantime, clean the chicken by
      exfoliating with kosher or coarse salt. Rinse chicken well, inside and
      outside.<br />
      2. PRE-BOIL CHICKEN: When water is at a hard boil, add the chicken. Return
      to hard boil, let scum come to the surface. Boil for 5 minutes. Discard
      all the water, including the scum.<br />
      3. Refill pot with clean water to cover the chicken by 1-inch, and add in
      the garlic, green onion and ginger. Bring the pot to a boil over high
      heat, then immediately turn the heat to low to keep a simmer. Cook for
      about 30 minutes more (less if you're using a smaller chicken). Check for
      doneness by sticking a chopstick into the flesh under the leg and see if
      the juices run clear or insert a thermometer into the thickest part of the
      thigh not touching bone. It should read 160F. The chicken will continue to
      cook to 165F during rest.<br />
      4. When the chicken is cooked through, turn off the heat and remove the
      pot from the burner. Immediately lift and transfer the chicken into a bath
      of ice water to cool. The quick cooling will stop the cooking process,
      keeping the meat soft and tender, and giving the skin a lovely firm
      texture. After cooling, pat the chicken dry with paper towels and rub the
      sesame oil all over the chicken. This will help prevent the chicken from
      drying out.<br />
